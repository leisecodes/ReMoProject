<h1>Maine Student Book Award</h1>
<h2>Student Application Prototype</h2>

<p>This web application was developed by Sarah Gallant, Leise Crandall, and Xueyan Feng in partnership with ReMo to meet the requests of the Maine Student Book Award Organization. 
It includes the student facing side of the application, from which students can view the annual list of books, review the details of each book, record feedback on books
they have read, and set goals. <br><br> The front end of this application was created in React, and the backend server was implemented in Nodejs. It is currently being run on Render.com.
The project pulls from a MongoDB Atlas database built by the team.

<p>Screenshots of the application interfaces are below:</p>
